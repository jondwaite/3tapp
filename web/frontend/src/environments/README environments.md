# Environments #

This directory is intentionally left empty, the environment.ts file that usually lives here is dynamically generated by the /scripts/setenv.ts file (called by `package.json` when `npm start` runs). This allows dynamic (deployment time) environment variables to be included from the `.env` file. Otherwise Angular tries to statically create the contents of `environment.ts` which can't then alter to deployment conditions.

Note that for testing we're using 'npm start' to run the web site in Development mode - this would absolutely not be suitable for production use where `npm build` should be used to generate the site and then a web server used to serve the artifacts from /dist.
